### Github Assignment

I am modifying this for the first assignment!

GitHub assignment: I learned how to resolve merge conflicts!

### Simon HTML Assignment
- One of the main things that this assignment taught me was how to add hyperlinks to other pages on the website so that you can click on the link to see a different page. 
- Another thing that I learned on this assignment was how to use a header, main, and footer to set up a logical structure for the webpage. 

### CSS
- CSS Practice assignment: learned about selectors, declarations, fonts, and animations. 
- CSS Flex: to make a body element a responsive flexbox, set the display property to flex; `flex: 1` means that it will get one fractional unit of growth, while `flex: 0 80px` won't allow that element to grow and will give it a starting height of 80pixels

### Simon CSS Assignment
- To show that a certain navigation bar item is selected, set the class of that link to "nav-link active" instead of just "nav-link"
- When you need to set multiple aspects of the margin to different things, you can just do `margin: top right bottom left` instead of assiging each value of margin in a separate line
- Using the `!important` rule overrides all previous styling rules for that property on that element
